# ECG Classification

A machine learning project that classifies ECG images into four classes:

- Normal Rhythm
- Myocardial Infarction (MI)
- History of MI
- Abnormal Heartbeats

Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and compared with traditional ML models (SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, EfficientNet).

## Models Used

-  CNN (Custom)
-  EfficientNet (Pretrained)
-  SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost (Traditional ML)

## Results Summary

| Model        | Accuracy | 
|--------------|----------|
| CNN          |   98%    | 
| EfficientNet |   88%    | 
| XGBoost      |   93%    | 
| AdaBoost     |   95%    | 
| SVM          |   93%    | 

> Grad-CAM was used for model explainability.
