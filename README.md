# ECG Classification

A machine learning project that classifies ECG images into:

- Normal Rhythm
- Myocardial Infarction (MI)
- History of MI
- Abnormal Heartbeats

Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and compared with traditional ML models (SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, EfficientNet).

## Models Used
- CNN
- SVM
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost
- EfficientNet

## Dataset
- Collected from NIH, Mendeley, and Kaggle.
- Stored in Google Drive (not uploaded due to size/privacy).

## How to Run
- Open Colab notebook
- Mount Google Drive
- Update data paths
- Run training/evaluation

## Results
- CNN Accuracy: 0.98%
- Best Ensemble Model: 0.88%
